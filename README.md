## Ping-Pong

This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions: numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping," numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong," and numbers divisble by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong." This is a third-week project at Epicodus; namely, it's the Ping-Pong project.
